# PGE_Clicker
A Cookie Clicker clone in the Pixel Game Engine in C++

All graphics and names are placeholders. Core functionality is there but I got bored and stopped.

This is implemented using the Pixel Game Engine created by Javidx9. His youtube channel can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9
